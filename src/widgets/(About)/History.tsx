          Carmel Polytechnic College was established in the year 1958 by Very
          Rev. Fr Gilbert Palakunnel CMI, a member of the Congregation of the
          Carmelites of Mary Immaculate. The religious congregation CMI has
          inherited a rich legacy left by the founder Saint Kuriakose Elias
          Chavara. This legacy is a commitment to work for the deprived and the
          marginalized, empowering them through quality education.
        </p>

        <p>
          Carmel Polytechnic College is yet another instance of the service by
          the members of the CMI Congregation to the nation and the church
          through educational, pastoral and social service to the poor and the
          needy. When Fr Gilbert Palakunnel CMI reached Alappuzha, he was on a
          struggle against the forces which were trying to perpetuate a culture
          of hatred and violence based on communal discord and atheism.
        </p>

        <p>
          The great visionary he was, he found the only solution to the
          restlessness and troubles in this area was to help the young men find
          employment and have a steady income. At a time when the Christian
          churches in Kerala were hesitant to step into the field of technical
          education, Fr Gilbert took the bold decision to start a technical
          institute on the lands of Alappuzha.
        </p>

        <p>
          In spite of the fact that the establishment and running of such an
          institution was arduous and involved huge financial commitment, Fr
          Gilbert took courage to start this institution with a firm
          determination to contribute to the national development in general and
          to the student community in particular.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was with rather great difficulty that he obtained the no objection
          and technical sanction from the State government, for which Rev. Fr
          William CMI (Principal, S.B. College, Changanacherry and Syndicate
          Member, Kerala University) and Sri K.C. Chacko (Director of Technical
          Education) were instrumental.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Ministry of Scientific & Cultural Affairs of the Government of
          India approved the proposal to start the three-year Diploma courses in
          Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering branches on 19 May 1958,
          with an annual intake of 120 students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, the management hired a building on C.C.S.B. roadside near
          the municipal office at Alappuzha to start the functioning of the
          Polytechnic and another building for the hostel. Mr. P.C. Joseph
          (Retd. Highway Engineer) was appointed as the acting Principal.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 15th of August in 1958, the Assumption Day of the Blessed Virgin
          Mary and the 11th Anniversary of Indian Independence, was the day of
          the ‘Blessing’ of our institution. On 18th August 1958, the
          institution started its functioning with the inaugural classes engaged
          by Mr. Josey Thomas (Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics) — a small and
          humble beginning of a great institution, yet the fulfillment of a
          long-cherished ambition of Rev. Fr Gilbert Palakunnel CMI.
        </p>

        <p>
          The self-financing section was added in 2003 with diploma courses in
          Computer and Electronics Engineering and Automobile Engineering in
          2004.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the very beginning, Carmel Polytechnic College has been keen on
          maintaining academic excellence, discipline inside and outside campus,
          a politics and strike-free environment, student-centered learning
          activities, and a strong social commitment.
